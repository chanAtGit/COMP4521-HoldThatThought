# COMP4521-HoldThatThought
COMP4521 Project - HoldThatThought is a mobile read-it-later application designed to help users move from saving to actually finishing and remembering what they read. It targets students, professionals, and general readers who often save large numbers of articles but rarely return to them due to distraction, stress, or lack of motivation.
